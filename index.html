                <p>Hi! My name is Brayden Ngo and I'm currently a junior studying Comptuer Science at the University
                    of Maryland. I grew up in my hometown of Perry Hall, Maryland which is located in Baltimore County. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy watching football, playing games, and riding my electric skateboard. Recently, I've
                    also been getting more into basketball. In the future, I hope to become a full-time software engineer. I'm not
                    really sure if I want to focus on front-end or back-end development at this time, but I'm looking forward to
                    explore new opporuntities! 
                </p>

                    <p>PersonaL Portfolio project that I worked on during the summer of 2022. This was my 
                        first experience using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. I hosted the webpage using
                        Github Pages and it can be found at <a href='https://braydenngo.github.io/'>https://braydenngo.github.io/</a>

                    <h2>NFL Game Predictor</h2>
                    <p>For my CMSC320 Data Science course, my final project involved doing analysis on data of past NFL
                        games. During my exploratory analysis, I examined different factors such as home field advantage, 
                        rushing, passing yards, etc. to see what effect they had on the outcome of games. At the end, I fed the 
                        data into the scikit random forest library to predict games. This tutorial project can be found at

                    <h2>Byte Buddies</h2>
                    <p>This was a project my group and I were building for Bitcamp 2023. While we didn't end up finishing
                        we still had a great time working together at our first hackathon! Our idea was to create a web application
                        that would make apartment and housing easier for new interns. We always see interns on sites like reddit and
                        discord making posts about DMing for other interns that are in the same area for housing for their upcoming internship
                        so we wanted to make an application that would make this process easier. For our tech stack, we ended up using
                        HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end and the Django framework for our backend. In order to host the website,
                        we attempted to use Microsoft Azure. You can find the Github repo at the following link: <a href = 'https://github.com/BraydenNgo/ByteBuddies'>https://github.com/BraydenNgo/ByteBuddies</a>
